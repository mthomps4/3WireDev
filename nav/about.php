  <div class="bio">
    <p>To describe myself in one word, I am a builder. I wake up in the morning geared to create, fix, learn, and solve. It’s an itch. It is the process that keeps me motivated. I am a Designer, Web Developer, Traditional Woodworker, a "Do It Yourselfer", and Adventuring Thinker. It's in my nature to break objects down part by part to understand function. I enjoy the process and history that lies within each piece. I’m always learning, innovating, always thinking. It’s a never ending process. </p>
  </br>
    <p>I graduated with a B.A. in Art from Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, emphasizing in Sculpture and Graphic Design with a minor in Physics. While at Georgetown, I met my wife Emily and soon followed her to Louisville, Kentucky. Currently, I manage the network and communications for Broadway Baptist Church in Louisville, while gaining more experience in Web Development as a freelancer.</p>
  </br>
    <p>At the end of the day it’s nice to “unplug”. When I’m not behind a computer, you will normally find me around a workbench. With a passion for traditional woodworking I continue to learn and hone my craft by focusing on hand tools and furniture making. My goal is to keep trade skills from becoming another chapter in the history book. Learning and sharing what I can, you can follow the process<a href="/#/blog"> on my blog</a> or follow me on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/3wirebuild/" target="_blank">@3WireBuild</a>.</p>
